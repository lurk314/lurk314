- 👋 Hi, I’m @lurk314, I am from central California but living in Utah. I am very new to this whole coding community
but I am very excited for a future (I hope) in this field.
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things from back-packing to surfing, looking for native american artifacts to woring on 
my truck. I started getting into this, or this coding thing was on a semi-bucketlist i guess, as something I really wanted
learn for a few years now but I had never found the right course or made time to learn it.Now being in utah I have time 
and I discovered The Odin Project.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, then I want to go on to Ruby on Rails, then I want to learn Javascript. I am open 
suggestions on what is up and coming and after I finist this course I would love to keep learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... well I dont know yet, but I would love to meet people sho are learning like I am and 
anyone who is willing to guide or mentor me in any way while I am on this journey
- 📫 How to reach me You can DM or add me as a friend on here, on discord my name is Loki314, I just really want to be apart
of this and I am having so much fun doing, learnig, and creating. Ihope you reach out and we make some stuff together.
